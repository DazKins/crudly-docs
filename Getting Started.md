# Getting Started

There are 2 main parts to getting started with Crudly:

1. [Setting up your projects/tables using the Crudly web application](./Getting%20Started%20(Crudly%20Web).md)
2. Accessing and using your Crudly projects/tables in your own applications. See the separate getting started guides for these:
   - [NodeJS](./nodejs/Getting%20Started.md)
