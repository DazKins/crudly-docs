# Project

The project is the root level of the Crudly API. A project can contain any number of tables.

## Project ID/Key

Upon creating your project through the Crudly UI you should receive a `projectId` and `projectKey`. These are used to authenticate your requests to the API. You will only be given the `projectKey` once so make sure to store it somewhere safe. The `projectId` you will be able to find at any time through the Crudly UI.
